## ‚úÖ Project Tests (User Stories)

1. You should provide your own project, not the example URL.
2. You can POST a URL to `/api/shorturl` and get a JSON response with `original_url` and `short_url` properties. Here's an example: `{ original_url : 'https://freeCodeCamp.org', short_url : 1}`
3. When you visit `/api/shorturl/<short_url>`, you will be redirected to the original URL.
4. If you pass an invalid URL that doesn't follow the valid `http://www.example.com` format, the JSON response will contain `{ error: 'invalid url' }`
